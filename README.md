# ðŸ“… Build and Deploy a Calendly Clone

This project-based course walks me through building a full-stack Calendly clone from scratch using **Next.js 15**, **Clerk** for authentication, **Tailwind CSS**, and a modern tech stack. 

I've learned how to:
- Create and manage event types
- Implement user availability and scheduling
- Handle full-stack logic using server actions
- Deploy your app to the web using **Vercel**

Perfect for developers looking to sharpen their full-stack skills with real-world functionality.# calendra
